# p32p6
A simple command line tool that converts an ASCII/plain ppm image into a binary/raw one.
```
Usage:
        p32p6 image.ppm
```
Currently, this tool is only able to convert space delimited plain ppm files.
The [specification](https://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html) dictates that all ASCII whitespace characters are valid delimiters, but that is TBD.
